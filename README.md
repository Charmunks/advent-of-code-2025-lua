# Ivie's Lua Advent of Code 2025 Solutions
This will be the home for my solutions to Advent of Code 2025

Every solution will be written in lua, using the [Astra](https://astra.arkforge.net/) lua framework.

Each solution will have its own folder in the repo

## Running my solutions

Requirements: [Astra](https://astra.arkforge.net/docs/latest/getting_started.html) lua runtime

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Charmunks/advent-of-code-2025-lua/
cd dirname # the name of the solutions folder
astra export-bundle # optional, needed for IntelliSense/editor autocomplete
astra run main.lua
```
